I was building my SaaS side project when I realized I needed to add passkeys. Everyone talks about better security and user experience, but I had no idea where to start. Would I need to rebuild my entire auth system? How complicated is this stuff?

Turns out, it‚Äôs way simpler than I thought. You don‚Äôt need to break your existing login flow to add passkeys. Let me walk you through how I added them in a single weekend, kept everything working smoothly, and got ready for when users start signing up.

## What Are Passkeys, Anyway?

Passkeys are a secure, passwordless login method using biometrics (like your fingerprint or face scan) or device-based authentication. They‚Äôre basically the user-friendly names for the FIDO2 and WebAuthn standards.

Here‚Äôs the gist: when you create a passkey, your device makes a unique cryptographic key pair. The private key stays locked on your device (protected by your fingerprint or PIN), while the public key goes to the server. During login, your device signs a challenge with the private key, and the server checks it with the public key.

No passwords. No phishing. No credential stuffing (that‚Äôs when attackers reuse leaked passwords across multiple sites, hoping one works).

Think of them as a futuristic ‚ÄúLogin with Google‚Äù button, minus the third-party dependency and with top-notch security. Plus, they can sync across devices through providers like Apple iCloud Keychain, Google Password Manager, and 1Password. Cross-device sync is a game-changer.
Important note: the PIN or biometric you use doesn‚Äôt sync. That‚Äôs just the local way your device unlocks its stored keys. The actual passkey itself is what gets synced through your Apple/Google/1Password account.

## The Simplest Way to Add Passkeys (That Actually Works)

### Step 1: Add One Button

I added a single passkey button to my login form‚Äîno database chaos, no 3 a.m. panic sessions.

```javascript
{
	/* Only show if browser supports passkeys */
}
{
	supportsPasskeys() && (
		<button
			type="button"
			onClick={handlePasskeyLogin}
			className="w-full rounded-lg border-2 border-dashed border-gray-300 p-3 hover:border-gray-500"
		>
			üîê Try Passkey Login
		</button>
	);
}
```

### Step 2: Let Users Opt In (But Encourage It)

I don‚Äôt force passkeys on signup, but I nudge users after a few password logins: "Use a passkey. Skip the password."

### Step 3: Use a Service (You've Got Features to Ship)

I could‚Äôve spent months wrestling with WebAuthn docs, but I‚Äôm pre-revenue and need to ship. After some research, I picked Clerk; their Next.js integration is smooth, and the passkey setup is painless.

**Other solid options:**

- **Stytch**: Great for startups, generous free tier.
- **Auth0**: The enterprise choice, now with much better passkey UX.
- **Corbado**: Super fast setup, great for MVPs.
- **Descope**: Most flexible for custom flows, has a visual workflow builder.
- **Supabase Auth**: Passkeys now supported if you‚Äôre already on Supabase.
  Integration took me ~2 hours.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

‚ùå **Forcing passkeys on everyone**: Don't. Make it optional but encouraged.
‚ùå **Overhauling the database**: Just add a table for passkey data (public key, credential ID, device info). Existing users won't notice.
‚ùå **Learning WebAuthn from scratch**: Use a service and ship faster.
‚ùå **Ignoring backup scenarios**: Plan for when users lose devices.
‚ö†Ô∏è **Keep in mind**: Passkeys require HTTPS (localhost works for testing). Custom local domains need proper HTTPS, or WebAuthn will throw errors.

## Advanced Considerations

### Service Reliability & Vendor Lock-in

If your passkey provider goes down, most have 99.9% uptime, but keep email/password as a backup. Export user data regularly so you can switch providers if needed.

### User Management Features

Users should manage passkeys like passwords. I added:

- **View registered devices**: "iPhone 17, MacBook Pro, Windows Desktop"
- **Remove old passkeys**: For lost/replaced devices
- **Passkey naming**: "Work Laptop" vs "Personal Phone"
- **Usage analytics**: Show last login times per device

## Why You Should Add Passkeys Now

- **User expectation**: Feels modern, missing it feels outdated.
- **Competitive edge**: Still ahead of many apps, but not for long.
- **Security story**: Great for investors and enterprise clients.
- **Support costs**: Less password reset chaos.
- **Better conversion**: Easy login = better retention.
- **Future compliance**: Some industries will require strong authentication.

## Your Playbook for Adding Passkeys

1. **Start small**: Add the login button and basic flow.
2. **Pick a service**: Stytch for startups, Clerk for full-stack, Auth0 for enterprise, Corbado for speed. Don‚Äôt reinvent the wheel.
3. **Make it optional but encourage it**: Nudges > forcing.
4. **Test everywhere**: Mobile, desktop, cross-device sync.
5. **Plan for problems**: Lost devices, account recovery.
6. **Track adoption**: See what works.
7. **Ship it fast**: This isn‚Äôt just a nice-to-have anymore.

## The Bottom Line

It took me one weekend to add passkeys, and now my app is ready for users. Better security, smoother UX, and fewer support headaches.

Building something cool? I‚Äôd love to hear what you‚Äôre working on. If you‚Äôve added passkeys to your project, drop a comment with your experience. I‚Äôm always learning too.
