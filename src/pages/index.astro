			I am Teona, a front-end developer who loves to share my experiences through blogging. I really enjoy working with Python and Vue because they allow me to create beautiful and visually appealing designs. When I'm not writing code, I love to explore my creative side by taking in-game photos, or just relaxing with a nice cup of coffee and a good book. I'm always eager to learn new things and expand my horizons, and I find it especially exciting to delve into uncharted territory and explore new technologies.

			So, let's geek out together and discover what we can achieve! (='.'=)
